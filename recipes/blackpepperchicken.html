    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This black pepper chicken tastes just like the Chinese takeout favorite, golden-fried chicken in a soy, wine, and black pepper sauce, and served over white rice. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 cup green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup white onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather Ingredients.</li>
        <li>For Chicken Coating, whisk together cornstarch, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and pepper in a large bowl. Mixture will be quite thick. Add chicken pieces to bowl; stir to coat chicken. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for Black Pepper Sauce, whisk together chicken broth, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, water, cornstarch, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken. Cook and stir until lightly browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken. Remove chicken from skillet. </li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to skillet. Stir in minced garlic and ginger. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in bell pepper and onion. Cook and stir until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour in Black Pepper Sauce and cook until sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Return cooked chicken to skillet. Cook and stir until all ingredients are coated with sauce. Serve immediately over cooked white rice. </li>
    </ol>
